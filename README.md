## Task Description
Write and test software to support a simple geometry processing pipeline that is to be used as part of a stream processing framework. Facial recognition is a more sophisticated
form of the same problem, however, more complex and dynamic. This program will use uses prerequisite knowledge of procedural programming and knowledge of C to write two separate but related programs. 
Generator: Write a Java or Python program to generate a set of 2D points satisfying a particular neighbourhood constraint. This is known as the Generator program.
Searcher: Write a C program that calculates the three closest 2D points and outputs whether these form a triangle. This is known as the Searcher program.
The Generator produced by this assignment should be interoperable with the Searcher program.

There are three components; the Java or Python program that generates points, the C program that performs the triangle search, and the software development environment.
The Generator program accepts command line arguments and generates output to stdout. The Searcher receives input from stdin and produces output to stdout. The software development environment is tying it all together.
